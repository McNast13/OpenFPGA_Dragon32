# Build log

What changed, build result, resource use and timing numbers for each build.

## 2026-09-26 — CI run #1 (36238957368) — failed

First push, unmodified template `core_top.v`. Failed at the "Compile with
Quartus" step, before Quartus itself ever ran:

```
docker: failed to register layer: write /opt/intelFPGA/quartus/common/devinfo/programmer/sfl_enhanced_04_02e060dd.sof: no space left on device
```

Cause: `raetro/quartus:18.1` is a large image; GitHub's default `ubuntu-latest`
runner disk filled during the Docker layer pull, before compilation started.
Not a Quartus/timing/fit problem — infra only.

Fix: added a "Free disk space" step (`jlumbroso/free-disk-space@main`,
clearing the runner's preinstalled tool caches) before the Docker steps in
`.github/workflows/build.yml`. Also worth noting: the sibling
`../OpenFPGA_ZX-Spectrum` workflow this was modeled on turned out to have no
run history of its own on GitHub, so it wasn't actually a proven pattern —
just an untested template.

## 2026-09-26 — CI run #2 (36239286651) — succeeded

Same unmodified template `core_top.v`, after the disk-space fix. Compiled,
converted to `.rbf_r`, and packaged clean.

- **Fitter:** Cyclone V, `5CEBA4F23C8` — 414/18,480 ALMs (2%), 722 registers,
  8,192/3,153,920 block memory bits (<1%), 1/4 PLLs, 0 DSP blocks. Tiny, as
  expected for a test-pattern-only core.
- **Timing:** all corners (slow/fast, 1100mV, 0C/85C) show positive setup,
  hold and minimum-pulse-width slack on every clock (`clk_74a`,
  `bridge_spiclk`, the PLL's `divclk`) — no negative TNS anywhere. Clean
  timing closure on the template as shipped.
- **Output:** `bitstream.rbf_r`, 786,972 bytes. Zip contents verified
  against the expected `Cores/Platforms/Assets` layout — matches.

**Phase 0 gate not yet confirmed on hardware** — the build pipeline works
end to end, but nobody has copied the zip to a Pocket SD card and looked at
the screen yet. That's the remaining step.
